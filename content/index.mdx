### Lumberyard: Creating Animated Characters in Blender

![Lumberyard: Creating Animated Characters in Blender](/images/custom_char_thumb_600.png "Lumberyard: Creating Animated Characters in Blender")
> Learn how to rig and animate a character for Amazon Lumberyard.  In this tutorial we'll create a basic character mesh with Blender's Sorcar addon, add an armature and weight paint the mesh for smooth deformations.  We'll also create a basic walk animation for the character and go over how to export everything to Amazon Lumberyard.  Finally, we'll set up character controls and an animation graph and demonstrate root-driven motion with the new character.

### Procedural Modelling in Blender - Sorcar Basics Pt. 1: Generating LOD's and Collision Meshes

![Procedural Modelling in Blender - Sorcar Basics Pt. 1: Generating LOD's and Collision Meshes](/images/Sorcar1_thumb.png "Procedural Modelling in Blender - Sorcar Basics Pt. 1: Generating LOD's and Collision Meshes")
> Get started with procedural modelling in Blender with the Sorcar addon.  In part 1 of the series we'll cover the basics of working with Sorcar.  We'll take a look at the FBX structure of a Lumberyard mesh and recreate it with Sorcar.  We'll make a high-quality base mesh with two simpler LOD meshes for the engine to render at a distance.  In addition we'll create a collision mesh for both legacy CryPhysics as well as PhysX.  We'll add a material to all of the meshes and import the finished product into Lumberyard.

### Procedural Modelling in Blender with Sorcar Part 2: More Meshes, For-loops, Variables and Noise

![Procedural Modelling in Blender with Sorcar Part 2: More Meshes, For-loops, Variables and Noise](/images/Sorcar2_thumb.png "Procedural Modelling in Blender with Sorcar Part 2: More Meshes, For-loops, Variables and Noise")
> In part 2 of the series we'll cover a better workflow for working with multiple meshes.  We'll use a pre-existing mesh to use as a starting point for procedural generation and learn how to use the three different types of For-loops available in Sorcar as well as highlighting some important Utility nodes.  Finally we'll create a simple example to demonstrate how to use the Noise nodes.

### Terrain: Blending with TerreSculptor and GIMP

![Blending with TerreSculptor and GIMP.](/images/terrain_blending_thumb.png "Blending with TerreSculptor and GIMP.")
> Learn to create and blend different terrains using TerreSculptor 2.0.  Design natural looking terrain, with greater control over features and placement. Blend real-world elevation data with other sources, including generated terrain and custom painted features.   Export a 4km x 4km megatexture for a 1km x 1km terrain to improve the look of your terrain in-game.  This tutorial also covers importing and using terrain megatextures in Lumberyard.

### Terrain: Blending Megatextures and Masks with GIMP

![Blending Megatextures.](/images/megatexture_blending_thumb.png "Blending Megatextures.")
> Techniques for blending megatextures and masks.  Create megatextures to apply to different parts of the terrain.  Use the erosion masks from terrain creation and the GIMP toolset to stylize the blended megatexture.

### Terrain: Blending and Splatmaps

![Terrain Blending and Splatmaps](/images/splatmaps_thumb.png "Terrain Blending and Splatmaps/")
> Additional terrain blending techniques using TerreSculptor and GIMP.  How to use splatmaps to mix megatextures and how to import them into Lumberyard to use for terrain layers.
